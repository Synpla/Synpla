- 👋 Hi, I’m @Synpla
- 👀 I’m interested in understanding the many outlets that make up code. From security to whitehat hacking I'm just trying to figure out where I fit.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ and python but I'm trying to see what coding languages may be important to know.
- 💞️ I’m not sure what to collaborate on because this is my first time on github so I'm still trying to figure it out.
- 📫 How to reach me is by my email at the moment.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm an avid hobbyist that likes to jump head first into anything that catches my interest.
